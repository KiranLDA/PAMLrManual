## Classifying migratory flight in European bee-eaters: the dataset

European bee-eaters (*Merops apiaster*) have been tracked on the their migrations from Germany (to the Congo Basin) using SOI-GDL3pam loggers. 

* **Pressure** is recorded every 15 minutes
* **Light** is recorded every 5 minutes
* **Activity** is recorded every 5 minutes
* **Pitch** is recorded every 5 minutes
* **Temperature** is recorded every 15 minutes
* **Tri-axial acceleration** is recorded every 4 hours
* **Tri-axial magnetic field** is recorded every 4 hours

```{r}
data("bee_eater")

# make sure the cropping period is in the correct date format
start = as.POSIXct("2015-08-20","%Y-%m-%d", tz="UTC")
end = as.POSIXct("2016-06-01","%Y-%m-%d", tz="UTC")

# Crop the data
PAM_data= create_crop(bee_eater,start,end)
```

## Visualise data

Sensor images are a good place to start when analysing data, as they can give a rapid overview of the dataset. Darker colors represent lower values, and lighter colors (in this case yellow) represent higher values. Sensor images for **activity** (also known as an actogram), **pitch**, **pressure** and **temperature** are a good place to start. The following code plots this for us:

```{r sensooor2, out.width='100%', fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', cache = FALSE}
par(mfrow= c(1,4), # number of panels
    oma=c(0,2,0,6), # outer margin around all panels
    mar =  c(4,1,4,1)) # inner margin around individual fivure

plot_sensorimage(PAM_data$acceleration$date, ploty=FALSE,
          PAM_data$acceleration$act, main = "Activity",
          col=c("black",viridis::cividis(90)), cex=1.2, cex.main = 2)

plot_sensorimage(PAM_data$acceleration$date, plotx=TRUE, ploty=FALSE, labely=FALSE,
          PAM_data$acceleration$pit,  main="Pitch",
          col=c("black",viridis::cividis(90)), cex=1.2, cex.main = 2)

plot_sensorimage(PAM_data$pressure$date, plotx=TRUE, ploty=FALSE, labely=FALSE,
          PAM_data$pressure$obs,  main="Pressure",
          col=c("black",viridis::cividis(90)), cex=1.2, cex.main = 2)

plot_sensorimage(PAM_data$temperature$date, labely=FALSE,
          PAM_data$temperature$obs,  main="Temperature",
          col=c("black",viridis::cividis(90)), cex=1.2, cex.main = 2)
```


## What should we look for?

Compared to the hoopoe, the activity patterns are less clear. However, there are some patterns become apparent.

* The bird is visibly **never active at night** - It only migrates during the day. 
* During migration (August and April) the overall **pressure changes from one night to the next** (horizontal bars of different colors). Indeed pressure varies geographically and altitudinally - suggesting that those nights the bird is somewhere different.
* During this migration period, **pressure drops substatially** as does **temperature** - indicating higher altitude flights than ususal
* During the migration period, **activity is low but sustained** 
* During the migration period, **pitch is constant**

```r
plot_interactive_timeseries(dta = PAM_data,
                 toPLOT = "pressure")
```

```{r dygraph-01, out.width='100%', out.height=400, echo=FALSE}
library(dygraphs)
dygraph(xts::xts(x = PAM_data$pressure$obs,
                 order.by = PAM_data$pressure$date), 
        xlab = "Time", 
        ylab = "Pressure (hPa)", 
        main = "Pressure as a function of time") %>%
  dyRangeSelector(dateWindow = c(PAM_data$pressure$date[1], PAM_data$pressure$date[length(PAM_data$pressure$date)])) %>%
  dyHighlight(highlightSeriesOpts = list(strokeWidth = 2)) %>%
  dyLegend(hideOnMouseOut = TRUE, width = 600) %>% 
  dyOptions(colors = "#FC8D62")
```


Some, if not all of these can therefore be used to identify migratory flight in European bee-eaters. We could for instance use `create_summary_statistics(..., method="endurance")` or `create_summary_statistics(..., method="pressure")` based on these data patterns. However, because these species **soar-glide** and are therefore in sunlight while thermalling (as opposed to hidden under leaves), periods of constant sunshine could also be used to identify migratory soar-gliding using`create_summary_statistics(..., method="light")`.


## What variables make the most sense for classifying?

We start with endurance flights. These can be extracted from the data using the following code.

```{r cache = FALSE}
# get twilights (general geolocator method)
twl = GeoLight::twilightCalc(PAM_data$light$date, PAM_data$light$obs,
                             LightThreshold = 2, 
                             ask = FALSE)

TOclassify = create_summary_statistics(dta = PAM_data,
                     method= "endurance",
                     light_thld = 2, 
                     twl = twl,
                     interp = TRUE)

# To look at the data use the following line. 
# Here it is commented out to avoid a messy document
# head(TOclassify)
```

We can then plot the data. Here, to save space, we plot the variables which on first glance seem to best distinguish migration from non-migration. These include:

* Long periods spend always activity: **duration**
* Active day where the bird changed pressure (i.e. altitude) a lot: **total_daily_P_change**
* Active periods where the pressure changed from one night to the next: **night_P_diff**
* Active periods where there were the bird's body wasin a specific position: **median_pitch**

```{r}
par(mfrow= c(4,1), # number of panels
    oma=c(0,0,0,0), # outer margin around all panels
    mar =  c(1,4,1,1)) # inner margin around individual fivure

plot(TOclassify$date, TOclassify$duration, type = "l",
            ylab = "Event duration", xlab="")

plot(TOclassify$date, TOclassify$total_daily_P_change, type = "l",
            ylab = "Cumul daily P chng", xlab="")

plot(TOclassify$date, TOclassify$night_P_diff, type = "l",
            ylab = "Pressure diff btwn nights", xlab="")

plot(TOclassify$date, TOclassify$median_pitch, type = "l",
            ylab = "Pitch", xlab="")
```



## Classify using HMM

There are two options for performing the classification of the data. One is to include multiple variables as is (see predictor 1 below). The other is to combine them into one metric (see predictor 2 below). The "hmm" method in `classify_summary_statistics` relies on the package `depmixS4`, and by default `classify_summary_statistics` treats each variable (i.e. a data column) with the formula `variable ~ 1` with `family = gaussian()`. Family can easily be changed, however for a more complicated model, it is recommended to  implement directly using the `depmixS4` package.

> Beware - some methods do not allow any NAs in the dataset

```{r}
# Get rid of any extra NAs 
TOclassify = TOclassify[complete.cases(TOclassify),]


# Select the columns to use as predictors in the model
predictor = TOclassify[, c("duration",
                            "night_P_diff",
                            "median_pitch",
                            "total_daily_P_change")]


# Perform the classification
classification = classify_summary_statistics(predictor,
                             states=2, 
                             method = "hmm")
```

### *Translate the classification events into something usable*

The classification results in a series of numbers which can be accessed under `classification$cluster`. These indicate the states of the individual during a given event, in this case "migrating" and "not migrating". However, we still need to figure out which number corresponds to which state, because these can be allocated randomly by the classification algorithm. 

First, we start by taking the classification, and adding the data from the flight events to the same resolution of the data that we want to plot, using `create_merged_classification()`. For example, we use pressure, as this displays soar-gliding behaviour quite well.


```{r}
# Convert the events to data
pressure_classification = create_merged_classification(from = TOclassify$start,
                                             to = TOclassify$end,
                                             classification = classification$cluster,
                                             add_to = PAM_data$pressure)

pressure_classification = data.frame(cluster=pressure_classification)
```

To do so, we find the sate with the largest pressure difference, because it will indicate the state where the bird was changing altitude the most and therefore soar-gliding, which will be most obvious during migration.


```{r}
# Find the pressure difference for each state
P_state1 = median(TOclassify$total_daily_P_change[classification$cluster == 1])
P_state2 = median(TOclassify$total_daily_P_change[classification$cluster == 2])
P_states = c(P_state1, P_state2)

# Allocate the state with the highest pressure difference to migration
Mig_state = which(P_states == max(P_states))

# Now add this information to the classification
pressure_classification$states = pressure_classification$cluster
pressure_classification$states[pressure_classification$cluster == Mig_state] = "Migration"
pressure_classification$states[pressure_classification$cluster != Mig_state] = "Active"
pressure_classification$states[is.na(pressure_classification$cluster)] = "Unclassified"

# Associate each state with a color
pressure_classification$colour = pressure_classification$cluster
pressure_classification$colour[pressure_classification$cluster == Mig_state] = "orange"
pressure_classification$colour[pressure_classification$cluster != Mig_state] = "royalblue3"
pressure_classification$colour[is.na(pressure_classification$cluster)] = "black"
```


### *Plot the classification*

Here we only plot sowthward migration, to help visualise the classification results.


```{r  out.width='100%', fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
par(mar=c(3,3,1,1))

# PLOT ALL THE DATA
# plot the pressure data
plot(PAM_data$pressure$date, PAM_data$pressure$obs, 
     type="l",
     ylab="Pressure (hPa)",
     xlab="Date")

# Add the classification to the plot
points(PAM_data$pressure$date, PAM_data$pressure$obs, 
       col=pressure_classification$colour, 
       pch=16,
       cex=0.8)

# Add a legend to see which color matches which classification
legend( PAM_data$pressure$date[length(PAM_data$pressure$date)/2],800 , 
        c("Unclassified", "Active", "Migrating" ) ,
        col = c("black", "royalblue3","orange"),
        pch=16)


# PLOT A SUBSET OF THE DATA
id = 400:3500
# plot the pressure data
plot(PAM_data$pressure$date[id], PAM_data$pressure$obs[id], 
     type="l",
     ylab="Pressure (hPa)",
     xlab="Date")

# Add the classification to the plot
points(PAM_data$pressure$date[id], PAM_data$pressure$obs[id], 
       col=pressure_classification$colour[id], 
       pch=16)

# Add a legend to see which color matches which classification
legend( PAM_data$pressure$date[id[length(id)-700]],800 , 
        c("Unclassified", "Active", "Migrating" ) ,
        col = c("black", "royalblue3","orange"),
        pch=16)
```

## Classify using pressure

Note from the previous classification where the pressure is very low, and therefore at very high altitudes, yet it was not active. This is because bee-eaters soar glide, and using this strategy, they flap their wings very little. Another way of classifying flight events, is to use a change in pressure greater than what we would expect from weather. In this case, pressure data are collected every 30 minutes, and we wouldn't expect a pressure change greater than 2hPa/30 minutes when the bird is on the ground (you can for instance use nightime when birds do not fly to determine what this threshold should be). Thus we set `Pdiff_thld = 2`. 

```{r}
# twl = GeoLight::twilightCalc(PAM_data$light$date, PAM_data$light$obs,
#                              LightThreshold = 2, 
#                              ask = FALSE)

TOclassify = create_summary_statistics(dta = PAM_data,
                     method= "pressure",
                     Pdiff_thld = 2,
                     light_thld = 2, 
                     twl = twl,
                     interp = TRUE)

# Get rid of any extra NAs 
TOclassify = TOclassify[complete.cases(TOclassify),]


# Select the columns to use as predictors in the model
predictor = TOclassify[, c("duration",
                            "night_P_diff",
                            "median_pitch",
                            "total_daily_P_change")]


# Perform the classification
classification = classify_summary_statistics(predictor,
                             states=2, 
                             method = "hmm")

## Classify using a changepoint analysis

The changepoint analysis looks for changes in the mean and/or variance in the data, and can be implemented in **pamlr** using `classify_changepoint`. We can perform this and compare with the previous classification seen above. It seems like `classify_changepoint` overclassifies migration within the migratory period, which `classify_summary_statistics` overclassifies migration during the non-breeding season in Africa.


```{r out.width='100%', fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
changepoints = classify_changepoint(PAM_data$pressure$obs)

# plot the timeseries 
plot(PAM_data$pressure$date, PAM_data$pressure$obs, 
     type="l",
     ylab="Pressure (hPa)",
     xlab="Date")

# Add the classification to the plot
points(PAM_data$pressure$date, PAM_data$pressure$obs, 
       col=pressure_classification$colour, 
       pch=16,
       cex=0.8)

# Add a legend to see which color matches which classification
legend( PAM_data$pressure$date[length(PAM_data$pressure$date)/2],800 , 
        c("Unclassified", "Active", "Migrating" ) ,
        col = c("black", "royalblue3","orange"),
        pch=16)

# Add the changepoints
abline(v=PAM_data$pressure$date[changepoints$changepoints], 
       col="red",
       lwd=2)
