**A toolbox for analysing animal behaviour using Pressure, Acceleration, Temperature, Magnetic and Light data in R**




# Introduction

This is a user manual accompanying the R package **pamlr**, which provides a set of functions for analysing behaviour from multisensor geolocator data - primarily for small migratory birds (however the methods are generalisable). The package is setup for SOI-GDL3**pam** loggers (developped by the [Swiss Ornithological Institute](www.vogelwarte.ch/en)) which measure atmospheric pressure (**P**), activity (**A**), magnetisim (**M**), temperautre and light. However, other multisensor geolocator data may be used, if it is formatted in the same format as SOI-GDL3pam data (see [Importing data](#import)).
